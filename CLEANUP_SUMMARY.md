## 🗂️ What's Being REMOVED (Examples)

### Development Screenshots (21 files, 3.4MB)
```

LIVE-LIBRARY-PROMPT-VIEW.png            396KB
... and 15 more screenshots
```
**Why:** Used during development to verify features. Not needed anymore.

### Test Scripts (15 files, 115KB)
```
bulk_import_visual_test.mjs              17KB
run_comprehensive_tests.mjs              16KB

```
dist.backup/
├── 2,376 old HTML prompt files
├── Old thumbnails directory
├── Old assets (JS/CSS)
└── Outdated prompts_index.json
```
**Why:** Old build from previous version. Current files are in `/public/`.

### Test Results (directories & files, 5MB)
```
test-results/
test-results-comprehensive/
sample-bulk-import.json
