```env
ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourNewPassword123!
```
Then restart API server.

### Export All Data
In admin dashboard:
1. Select prompts or leave all unselected
2. Click "Export JSON"
3. Downloads `prompts_export.json`

### Restore from Backup
Replace `public/prompts_index.json` with any backup file from `/backups/` folder.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Browse page shows 0 prompts
- Check: `public/prompts_index.json` exists
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
- Clear browser cache

### Admin shows wrong count
- Refresh the page (F5)
- Check API server is running: `http://localhost:3001`

### Can't login to admin
- Check `.env` file has correct password
- Default: `[SET_IN_.ENV_FILE]`
- Restart API server after changing

### Changes not appearing
- **Remember to refresh!** Changes appear after page reload
- Admin and Browse both read from the same file
- File updates are immediate, but pages need refresh
