Morning.

[]
Peter Wolf 1:07
Can you hear me?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 1:09
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 1:16
See, yesterday I had a few minutes that I looked at a couple things. OK,
let me share my screen.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 1:24
How's your speech or talk or whatever you have, you know?

[]
Peter Wolf 1:26
That went fine. It was fine. I so.
So it was in and looking around and can you see my screen?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 1:41
Yep.

[]
Peter Wolf 1:42
So look at how the prompts look now. Like they lost all their structure
and prompt God. They were all nice and clean and organized. It looks
like we lost all that. Is that possible to get back or how? What? What
happened there?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 1:51
Yep.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can fake. That should be easy.

[]
Peter Wolf 1:58
OK, OK. So that's one thing I would say to work on then also.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 2:03
Uh.

[]
Peter Wolf 2:09
Yeah, so like whatever the font is in here and the font here and then
down the bottom, they're all different sizes and fonts. Like you see all
this down here and we can try and make them consistent as well and then.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 2:18
Yeah.
Yeah.

[]
Peter Wolf 2:26
Sorry, hold one second.
Sorry about that. We talked about this. I would take the department and
I'd put that first and then put the the name behind it. And also I mean
I would probably make this the same size font.
Right. Is this smaller? I think that would be, let me see. Yeah, I think
that'd be good. So those were the only three, the couple things that I
just had time to look at. I was just going in. So I'll now I'm kind of
in and out again in meetings here.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 3:01
Thanks.

[]
Peter Wolf 3:19
But I will I I I do my best to try and get in and and give you some more
stuff to to work on, OK?

[]
Nicholas Westburg 3:25
Yeah, just like if you wanna mess around like with the bulk import and
just like adding the prompts like that stuff just to see if the sync is
good. Yeah, no worries.

[]
Peter Wolf 3:33
Yeah, I'm not gonna have time. Yeah, I'm not gonna have time to do that.
But I'm hoping at least I can come up with some of the structure stuff
to give you a little bit more guidance on that. But let me see what I
can get to. OK. All right.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 3:46
Yeah, yeah, no worries either. So I'll yeah, I'll look into that. I I
that was that's one thing that was bothering me too. And I I tried to
reiterating and I guess it wasn't understanding, but I was also trying
to it was in build process.

[]
Peter Wolf 4:04
OK.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 4:04
So I I didn't really solely, you know, I said, you know, why is this
structure not clean and really like generically and simply and it's like
define like define clean.

[]
Peter Wolf 4:11
OK.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 4:19
And I just like, I guess I just wasn't doing that. But yeah, I think
that should be easy if I focus on that.

[]
Peter Wolf 4:24
OK.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 4:25
OK.
You there?

let me know if you need anything and, you know, you can ping me. OK. All
right.

[]
Nicholas Westburg 5:31
Yeah, I'll get started on that. I gotta, I gotta got a bunch of good
**** on my, my, uh, my whiteboard too that I've noted out just for,
yeah.
