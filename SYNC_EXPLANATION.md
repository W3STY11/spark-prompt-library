# 🔄 How Admin and Browse Library Stay Synced

## The Single Source of Truth

**File:** `/public/prompts_index.json` (9.2 MB with 2,376 prompts)

Both the admin dashboard and browse library read from and write to this **EXACT SAME FILE**.

---

## How It Works

### Browse Library (browse.html)
```
User opens browse.html
    ↓
Frontend JavaScript loads
    ↓
Calls: GET /api/prompts
    ↓
API reads: prompts_index.json
    ↓
Returns all 2,376 prompts
    ↓
Displays in browse interface
```

**When user adds a prompt:**
```
User clicks "Add Prompt"
    ↓
Fills form and submits
    ↓
Calls: POST /api/prompts
    ↓
API writes to: prompts_index.json
    ↓
File updated immediately
    ↓
Page refreshes and shows new prompt
```

---

### Admin Dashboard (admin.html)
```
Admin logs in
    ↓
Calls: GET /api/prompts
    ↓
API reads: prompts_index.json (SAME FILE!)
    ↓
Returns all 2,376 prompts
    ↓
Displays in admin table
```

**When admin edits a prompt:**
```
Admin clicks "Edit" button
    ↓
Makes changes in modal
    ↓
Calls: PUT /api/prompts/:id
    ↓
API creates backup first
    ↓
API updates: prompts_index.json
    ↓
File updated immediately
    ↓
Admin table refreshes with changes
```

**When admin deletes a prompt:**
```
Admin clicks "Delete" button
    ↓
Confirms deletion
    ↓
Calls: DELETE /api/prompts/:id
    ↓
API creates backup first
    ↓
API removes from: prompts_index.json
    ↓
File updated immediately
    ↓
Prompt gone from both admin and browse
```

## Real-Time Sync Guarantee

### ✅ What Happens When You Edit/Delete in Admin:

1. **Backup Created**: Automatic timestamped backup before any change
2. **File Updated**: `prompts_index.json` is modified immediately
3. **API Serves New Data**: Next request gets updated data
4. **Browse Page Sees Changes**: When user refreshes or loads browse page

### Example Flow:

```
TIME  | ADMIN ACTION              | prompts_index.json      | BROWSE VIEW
------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------
10:00 | Admin edits prompt #123   | Updated immediately     | Still shows old
10:00 | (edit saved)              | New content in file     | (not refreshed yet)
10:01 | -                         | -                       | User refreshes
10:01 | -                         | -                       | Sees new content!
```

## Verification

### Test 1: Check Current State
```bash
# Count prompts in file
cat public/prompts_index.json | jq '.meta.total_prompts'
# Output: 2376
```

### Test 2: Browse Library
```
Open: http://localhost:3003/browse.html
Shows: 2,376 prompts
```

### Test 3: Admin Dashboard
```
Open: http://localhost:3003/admin-login.html
Login with: [SET_IN_.ENV_FILE]
Shows: 2,376 prompts in table
```

### Test 4: Edit and Verify Sync
```
1. In Admin: Edit any prompt
2. Refresh browse.html
3. Changes appear immediately ✅
```

## Why This Works

Both interfaces hit the same API endpoints:
- `GET /api/prompts` → Reads `prompts_index.json`
- `POST /api/prompts` → Writes to `prompts_index.json`
- `PUT /api/prompts/:id` → Updates `prompts_index.json`
- `DELETE /api/prompts/:id` → Removes from `prompts_index.json`

**File System = Database**

Every read gets the latest data.
Every write updates the file immediately.
Perfect synchronization guaranteed.

---

## Backup System

**Before every edit/delete:**
```
prompts_index.json → backups/prompts_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_reason.json
```

**Retention:**
- Last 100 backups kept
- 30-day retention policy
- Automatic cleanup

**Manual backup:**
- Click "💾 Backup Now" button in admin
- Creates instant snapshot

---

## Summary

✅ **Admin and Browse are ALWAYS in sync**
✅ **Changes happen immediately in the file**
✅ **No database, no replication, no lag**
✅ **Backups protect against mistakes**
✅ **Single source of truth: prompts_index.json**

**Result:** When you edit/delete in admin, it updates the file. When someone loads browse.html, they get the updated file. Perfect sync! 🎉
