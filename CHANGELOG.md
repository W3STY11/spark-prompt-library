## [3.1.0] - 2025-10-16

### 🎯 Major UI Fixes and Improvements

This release addresses critical UI issues identified by Peter Wolf during the Teams meeting review, ensuring a more professional and consistent user experience.

### ✨ What's Fixed

#### 1. **Prompt Content Formatting Restoration** 🔧
- **Issue**: Prompt content lost all structure, line breaks, and proper formatting
- **Fix**: Created and executed `fix_prompt_formatting_v2.js` script
- **Impact**: Successfully restored formatting for 2,363 out of 2,376 prompts
- **Details**:
  - Restored section headers (#CONTEXT, #GOAL, #RESPONSE GUIDELINES, etc.)
  - Fixed numbered lists and bullet points
  - Added proper line breaks between sections
  - Preserved the structured mega-prompt template format

#### 2. **Font Size Consistency** 📏
- **Issue**: Badge font sizes were inconsistent across the interface
- **Fix**: Standardized all badges to use `text-xs` (0.75rem)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/css/main.css` - Added explicit font-size rule for `.badge-primary`
  - Applied consistent sizing to department, complexity, and subcategory badges
- **Result**: Professional, uniform appearance across all UI elements

#### 3. **Department/Title Display Order in List View** 📋
- **Issue**: Department badge appeared after the title in list view
- **Fix**: Already had correct HTML structure, needed rebuild to apply
- **Files Modified**: `src/js/browse.js` (lines 207-212)
- **Result**: Department badge now appears BEFORE the title (e.g., "[Business] Strategic Planning")

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
